# !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
# !! Note 1: this configuration file is for installed linapple

# !! If you have edited Makefile (in src directory of linaple package) 
# !! to change INSTDIR - path where lianpple are to be installed 
# !! you should consider change some paths for disk images and FTP local directory 
# !! in order to let linapple find proper way to access needed stuff


# !! 	Good luck to You! (beotiger: beotiger@mail.ru)


# Note 2: Default install directory (for *nix) is /mnt/sdcard/opentom/share/linapple/ 
# (defined in Make file in src directory as INSTDIR variable)
